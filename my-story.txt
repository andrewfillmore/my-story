This is the beginning of my pandemic year photo essay with Winnie. I'll be adding to this as time goes on with photos and text from the year.
I want to preserve some of the memories we shared in this insane year.

List of things to do:

* Gather images from phone
* Place images in appropriate folders
* Start gathering thoughts on any initial images I come across.
