This is the beginning of my pandemic year photo essay with Winnie. I'll be adding to this as time goes on with photos and text from the year.
I want to preserve some of the memories we shared in this insane year.

List of things to do:

* Gather images from phone
* Place images in appropriate folders
* Start gathering thoughts on any initial images I come across.
* Source wire photos from the year.
* Edit and modify any selects
 
 Figure out design ideas for this project. Does it live on the web or is it private?
 Is it an actual book or is it virtual?
